# CERN-CMS-Dimuon-spectrum-code
The codes of Dimuon invariant mass spectrum analysis and kinamatical data analysis.
The second task contain codes for kinematic variables of individual muons and the resonant particles.besides code that give pt of eta meson ,z boson using invariant mass filter is also included.
3rd task contain the codes of invariant mass distribution of each particle resonance
